#### ‚ÄÉ 4. Creat Pull Request

&emsp;   After modifying the file, the modified content only exists in the current branch of the modifier and needs to be submitted to the original author's warehouse through a Pull Request. Click on * * Create pull request * * to create a PR.

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/KF1AfmujhwcNgQn.jpg" height=500/></span></div>



<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/8synN6v5atPoUdw.jpg" height=500/></span></div>

&emsp;    After submitting as required, wait for the code warehouse management personnel to review and approve the PR you submitted.

### üîªMethod 2: Local modification submission

&emsp;   Local modification submission is suitable for situations such as significant changes, addition of new files, debugging code, etc. This method requires installation of Git

#### 1. fork Project

&emsp;¬†  Find the project to submit PR and first fork it into your own code repository.

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/wFICoTLxUj9NiJ2.jpg" height=500/></span></div>

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/G4UYbH85pQOJfxa.jpg" height=500/></span></div>

####  2. Clone open source project

‚ÄÉ Clone the project that needs to submit PR locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/guojin-yan/OpenVINO-CSharp-API.git
```

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/GOXw5iLmqf2clea.jpg" height=300/></span></div>

#### 3.  Create a new branch

&emsp;   When submitting PR, it is necessary to create a branch here to prevent modifications on the main branch from affecting the main branch code.

```
cd OpenVINO-CSharp-API
git checkout -b temp 
git branch 
git checkout temp
```

&emsp;   After switching the branches, you can directly modify the project according to your own needs, as shown in the above figure.

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/wW9DcrjzZEekfQT.jpg" height=300/></span></div>

#### 4. ‰øÆÊîπÊèê‰∫§È°πÁõÆ‰ª£Á†Å

&emsp;   After modifying the code, execute the ``git status`` command to see which files have been modified. Then use the ``git add`` modified file name 'to add it to the temporary storage area. Finally, use the ``git commit - m 'log information'  file name `` to submit it to the local library.

```
git status 
git add `file name`
git commit -m "log information" `file name`
```

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/i71frOAaZk2FwVU.jpg" height=300/></span></div>

&emsp;   Finally, submit the local project code to the remote GitHub;

```
git push --set-upstream main mybranch
```

&emsp;   Enter the GitHub project, switch to the mybranch branch, and check if the modification was successful.

&emsp;   Switch to the **main branch ** and merge the branch mybranch code into the main branch to see if it can be successfully merged with the main branch.

```
git checkout main 
git merge mybranch 
```

&emsp;   After the merge is successful, push the main branch to the code repository.

```
git add . 
git commit -m "log information" .
git push origin main
```

&emsp;   Switch to the master branch in GitHub and check if the merge was successful

#### 4. Submit PR 

&emsp;¬†Enter your ``fork`` project and click on ``Pull requests``

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/MjCINlbSD4Rx7sA.jpg" height=500/></span></div>

<div align=center><span><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/12/09/nNcUd8phGWfj1LH.jpg" height=500/></span></div>
